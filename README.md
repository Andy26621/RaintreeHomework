## assignment. details

This repository contains the first assignment. The assignment involves working with a MySQL database hosted locally and PHP scripting.
To run the scripts just execute the index files for exercise 2a, 2b and 3.
Additionally you will find 2 versions of each exercise in exercise2 a and b, since I made an inicial basic approach then made a refactor following OOP (Name of non refactored files are "exercice2adirty.php" and "exercice2bdirty.php"). 
Also tried to look forward over unit testing with phpunit trying to create a basic approach to unit test exercise 2b. (vendor/bin/phpunit tests)
